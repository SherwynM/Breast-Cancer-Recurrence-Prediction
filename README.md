# Breast Cancer Recurrence Prediction
[Video Demo](https://github.com/SherwynM/Breast-cancer/vid.mp4)

This project is a Django web application designed to predict the likelihood of breast cancer recurrence based on patient data. The prediction is powered by a machine learning model trained on breast cancer-related datasets.

## Features

- **User Input Form**: Collects patient data such as age, menopausal status, tumor size, and more.
- **Machine Learning Prediction**: Uses a trained model to predict whether cancer recurrence is likely.
- **Custom 404 Page**: Displays a styled "Page Not Found" error page for invalid URLs.

## How It Works

1. User inputs patient details in a web form.
2. The data is preprocessed to match the model's requirements.
3. A trained machine learning model predicts the recurrence status (No Recurrence or Recurrence).
4. The prediction result is displayed on the same page.
